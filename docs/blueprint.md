## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 67%, 47%) - RGB(30, 129, 229) A vibrant blue to inspire trust and confidence.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - RGB(242, 245, 249) - A light, desaturated blue, provides a clean and professional feel.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 40%) - RGB(51, 153, 153) - A teal, offers a contrasting but harmonious element for calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' gives a computerized feel that suits the function of the app, and the geometric letterforms have a financial style. Use 'Inter' to ensure readability for larger bodies of text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons related to money and transactions.
- A clean and straightforward layout to focus on the balance and ads. Prioritize a mobile-first approach.
- Subtle animations or transitions to give feedback on ad views and balance updates.
